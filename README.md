**Project Title:** Portfolio Optimization with Python and Yahoo Finance Data

**Project Description:** This project demonstrates how to use Python to analyze and optimize investment portfolios using real-world data from Yahoo Finance. It focuses on four major stock indices (S&P 500, TSX, STOXX 600, SSE) and explores different investment strategies like buy-and-hold and Sharpe ratio maximization.

**My Approach:**

* Data Retrieval: Retrieves historical stock data for the S&P 500, TSX, STOXX 600, and SSE indices from Yahoo Finance using the `requests` library.
* Data Processing: Cleans and prepares the data using pandas DataFrames, handling missing values and converting the date index to datetime format.
* Portfolio Optimization: Implements and compares different portfolio optimization strategies, including buy-and-hold and maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
* Visualization:  Uses `matplotlib` to create visualizations of portfolio performance, risk, and asset allocation.

**Key Tools and Technologies:**

* Python libraries: `io`, `re`, `requests`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
* Data Source: Yahoo Finance
* Stock Indices: S&P 500, TSX, STOXX 600, SSE

**Impact:** This project provides a practical guide to portfolio optimization using Python. It demonstrates how to retrieve, process, and analyze financial data to make informed investment decisions and achieve better risk-adjusted returns.
